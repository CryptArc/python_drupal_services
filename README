Python Drupal Services is a little module that lets you use Drupal Services in Python.

It's loosely based on several pieces of code found elsewhere:

 * http://drupal.org/project/Python_Services
 * http://www.speakingx.com/blog/2008/11/21/testing-out-drupals-service-module-using-python
 * http://drupal.org/node/308629


It can be found at http://github.com/guaka/python_drupal_services
